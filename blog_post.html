            When creating or growing a business, every entrepreneur comes across the same inevitable challenge – strategising. It is undoubtedly one of the most overwhelming activities to address, especially if you’re already knee deep in the operations and management of your venture.

            In the majority of cases, a business starts with a good idea and a basic action plan. As it progresses forward and gains traction, the day to day management can often take over pretty quickly. Let’s face it – addressing the daily demands of your business is daunting enough. Starting small and with limited resources, MDs often end up carrying the lion’s share of the responsibility and workload - representing the business, promoting it, driving sales, networking, marketing, motivating and managing the team. There are rarely enough hours in the day to cover every challenge that needs tackling. Therefore, the last thing any entrepreneur wants to hear from a mentor/investor is ‘Do you have a strategy, and more importantly, do you actually use it to govern your business activity?’.

            So how to find the right words?

          <p class="normal2 margin50">
            The most rewarding projects are sometimes the most challenging. When clients have a difficult problem that they haven’t been able to solve themselves, the more important our role in helping them solve this challenge:

            <li>

            The client is passionate about the industry and their brand offering.
          </p>
          <p class="normal2 margin80">
            However, collaboration is not all about challenging. It’s also about mutual respect and shared energy. Presenting a concept should be a special moment for both agency and client . For the client, it shows they’ve been listened to and they’ve successfully communicated what’s important. For an agency, the reward is to witness the joy and empowerment that follows.
